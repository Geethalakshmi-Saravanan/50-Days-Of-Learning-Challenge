# 50 Days of Preparation Challenge

A structured 50-day learning journey focused on strengthening core skills in **SQL**, **Python**, and **Data Engineering**, while building consistency and interview readiness.  
This repository documents my progress with daily problem-solving, notes, learnings, and improvements.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Build strong fundamentals in SQL and Python
- Practice real interview-style questions daily  
- Strengthen Data Engineering concepts (Spark, ETL, Pipelines, Scenarios)
- Improve problem-solving clarity and speed  
- Maintain consistency through disciplined daily learning  
- Create a visible, structured learning log for future review

---


Every folder typically includes:
- **Problem statements**
- **My solutions**
- **Corrected/optimized solutions**
- **Reasoning / explanation**
- **Extra practice problems** (if any)
- **Daily summary**
