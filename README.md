# 50-Days-Of-Learning-Challenge
50 Days of Preparation Challenge — a structured learning journey focused on strengthening SQL, Python, Data Engineering concepts, problem solving, and interview readiness.

This repository tracks my day-by-day progress through:

🟦 SQL problem solving (window functions, joins, analytics, scenarios)

🟩 Python basics to intermediate logic building

🟧 Data Engineering topics (Spark, ETL patterns, pipeline scenarios)

🟪 Real interview-type questions & reasoning

📝 Daily notes, learnings, and summaries

Each day’s folder contains:

Problem statements

My solutions

Improved / corrected versions

Notes or reasoning

Additional practice problems (if any)

The goal of this challenge is:

Building consistency

Improving problem-solving speed

Strengthening core concepts

Preparing confidently for data engineering/analytics interviews

Commit-by-commit, day-by-day, this repository reflects my path toward becoming technically stronger, clearer, and interview-ready.
